# Distaff assembly
Distaff assembly is a simple, low-level language for writing programs for Distaff VM. It stands just above raw Distaff VM [instructions](isa.md), and in fact, many instructions in Distaff assembly map directly to raw instruction of Distaff VM. However, Distaff assembly has several advantages:

* Distaff assembly supports *macro instructions*. These instructions expand into sequences of raw Distaff VM instructions making it easier to encode common operations.
* Distaff assembler takes care of properly aligning and padding all instructions reducing the amount of mental bookkeeping needed for writing programs.
* Distaff assembly natively supports control flow expression which the assembler automatically transforms into a program execution graph needed by Distaff VM.

### Compiling assembly code
To compile Distaff assembly source code into a program for Distaff VM, you can use the `compile()` function from the [assembly](https://github.com/GuildOfWeavers/distaff/blob/master/src/programs/assembly/mod.rs) module. This function takes the following parameters:

* `source: &str` - a reference to a string containing Distaff assembly source code.

The `compile()` function returns `Result<Program, AssemblyError>` which will contain the compiled program if the compilation was successful, or if the source code contained errors, description of the first encountered error.

For example:
```Rust
use distaff::{ assembly };

// the program pushes values 3 and 5 onto the stack and adds them
let program = assembly::compile("begin push.3 push.5 add end").unwrap();
```

## Assembly programs
A Distaff assembly program is just a sequence of instructions each describing a specific operation. You can use any combination of whitespace characters to separate one instruction from another. Every program must start with a `begin` instruction and terminate with an `end` instruction.

In addition to simple instructions sequences, Distaff VM supports the following control structures:

* *if-then-(else)* expressions for conditional execution;
* *repeat* expressions for bounded counter-controlled loops;
* *while* expressions for unbounded condition-controlled loops.

Each of these is described below.

### Conditional execution
Conditional execution in Distaff VM can be accomplished with *if-then-(else)* statements. These statements look like so:
```
if.true
    <instructions>
else
    <instructions>
end
```
where `instructions` can be a sequence of any instructions, including nested control structures; the `else` clause is optional. The above does the following:

1. Pops the top item from the stack.
2. If the value of the item is `1`, instructions in the `if.true` branch executed.
3. If the value of the item is `0`, instructions in the `else` branch are executed.
4. If the value is not binary (i.e. not `0` or `1`), the operation fails.

A couple of notes on performance:

* Number of instructions in each of the branches must be one less than a multiple of 16 (e.g. 15, 31, 47 etc.). If there not enough instructions, the assembler will pad the instructions with the appropriate number of `noop`'s. So, you don't need to worry about inserting `noop`'s manually. But, for simple *if-then-(else)* statements, it might be more efficient to use [selection instructions](#Selection-instructions) instead.
* For every level of nesting, the VM must allocate an additional register. To limit potential impact of this on performance, currently, *if-then-(else)* can be nested at most 16 levels deep. This should be sufficient for most use case, and if there is a need, will be increased in the future.

The above affects only nested *if-then-(else)* statements. So, when one *if-then-(else)* statement follows another, the VM does no need to allocate any additional registers.

### Counter-controlled loops
Executing a sequence of instructions a predefined number of times can be accomplished with *repeat* statements. These statements look like so:
```
repeat.<count>
    <instructions>
end
```
where:

* `instructions` can be a sequence of any instructions, including nested control structures.
* `count` is the number of times the `instructions` sequence should be repeated (e.g. `count.10`). `count` must be an integer greater than 1.

The assembler actually unfolds the body of the loop at compile time into repeated sequences of instructions. So, a *repeat* statement is just syntactic sugar.

A note on performance:

* Number of instructions in the body of the loop must be one less than a multiple of 16 (e.g. 15, 31, 47 etc.). As with *if-then-(else)* statements, the assembler will take care of all required padding, but if the loop is simple and/or repeated a small number of times, it might be more efficient to write out the repeated instructions manually.

### Condition-controlled loops
Executing a sequence of instructions zero or more times based on some condition can be accomplished with *while loop* expressions. These expressions look like so:
```
while.true
    <instructions>
end
```
where `instructions` can be a sequence of any instructions, including nested control structures. The above does the following:

1. Pops the top item from the stack.
2. If the value of the item is `1`, `instructions` in the loop body are executed.
    1. After the body is executed, the stack is popped again, and if the popped value is `1`, the body is executed again.
    2. If the popped value is `0`, the loop is exited.
    3. If the popped value is not binary (i.e. not `0` or `1`), the operation fails.
3. If the value of the item is `0`, execution of loop body is skipped.
4. If the value is not binary (i.e. not `0` or `1`), the operation fails.

A note on performance:

* For every nested loop, the VM must allocate 2 additional registers. To limit potential impact of this on performance, currently, loops can be nested at most 8 levels deep. This should be sufficient for most use case, and if there is a need, will be increased in the future. 

The above affects only nested loops. So, when one loop follows another, the VM does no need to allocate any additional registers.

## Instruction set
Instructions in Distaff VM are just keywords separated from each other by any combination of whitespace characters. Many instructions can be parametrized with a single parameter. The notation for specifying parameters is *operation.parameter*. For example, `push.123` describes a `push` operation which is parametrized with value `123`.

For most instructions which support parameters, the default parameter is set to `1`. For example, `dup` is equivalent to `dup.1`, `choose` is equivalent to `choose.1` and so on.

A single instruction may take multiple VM cycles to execute. The number of cycles frequently depends on the specified parameter, and sometimes depends on other factors (e.g. place of the operation in the execution path). The tables below include this number of cycles in the last column.

### Assertion instructions

| Operation | Description                            | Cycles |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | :----: |
| assert    | Pops the top item from the stack and checks if it is equal to `1`. If it is not equal to `1`, the operation fails. | 1 |
| assert.eq | Pops top two items from the stack and checks if they are equal. If they are not equal, the operation fails. | 1 |

### Input instructions

| Operation | Description                            | Cycles |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | :----: |
| push.*x*  | Pushes *x* onto the stack. *x* can be any valid field element. *push* operations can be executed only on steps which are multiples of 8 (e.g. 0, 8, 16 etc.). If a *push* operation in your program does not align with this, the assembler will pad it with the appropriate number of `noop`'s. | 1 - 7 |
| read.a    | Pushes the next value from the input tape `A` onto the stack. | 1 |
| read.ab   | Pushes the next values from input tapes `A` and `B` onto the stack. Value from input tape `A` is pushed first, followed by the value from input tape `B`. | 1 |

#### Input tapes
Distaff VM has two input tapes for supplying secret inputs to a program: tape `A` and tape `B`. You can use `read.a` and `read.ab` instructions to move value from these tapes onto the stack. When a value is read from a tape, tape pointer advances to the next value. This means, that a value can be read from a tape only once. If you try to read values from a tape which has no more values, the operation fails.

### Stack manipulation instructions

| Operation | Description                            | Cycles |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | :----: |
| noop      | Does nothing.                          | 1      |
| dup.*n*   | Pushes copies of the top *n* stack items onto the stack. *n* can be any integer between 1 and 4. | 1 - 3 |
| pad.*n*   | Pushes *n* `0`'s onto the stack; *n* can be any integer between 1 and 8. | 1 - 4 |
| pick.*n*  | Pushes a copy of the item with index *n* onto the stack. For example, assuming `S0` is the top of the stack, executing `pick.2` transforms `S0 S1 S2 S3` into `S2 S0 S1 S2 S3`. *n* can be any integer between 1 and 3. | 2 - 5 |
| drop.*n*  | Removes top *n* items from the stack; *n* can be any integer between 1 and 8. | 1 - 3 |
| swap.1    | Moves the second from the top stack item to the top of the stack (swaps top two stack items). | 1 |
| swap.2    | Moves 3rd and 4th stack items to the top of the stack. For example, assuming `S0` is the top of the stack, `S0 S1 S2 S3` becomes `S2 S3 S0 S1`. | 1 |
| swap.4    | Moves 5th through 8th stack items to the top of the stack. For example, assuming `S0` is the top of the stack, `S0 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7` becomes `S4 S5 S6 S7 S0 S1 S2 S3`. | 1 |
| roll.4    | Moves 4th stack item to the top of the stack. For example, assuming `S0` is the top of the stack, `S0 S1 S2 S3` becomes `S3 S0 S1 S2`. | 1 |
| roll.8    | Moves 8th stack item to the top of the stack. For example, assuming `S0` is the top of the stack, `S0 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7` becomes `S7 S0 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6`. | 1 |

### Arithmetic and boolean instructions

| Operation | Description                            | Cycles |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | :----: |
| add       | Pops top two items from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result onto the stack. | 1 |
| sub       | Pops top two items from the stack, subtracts the 1st item from the 2nd item, and pushes the result onto the stack.  | 2 |
| mul       | Pops top two items from the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result onto the stack. | 1 |
| div       | Pops top two items from the stack, divides the 2nd item by the 1st item, and pushes the result onto the stack. If the item at the top of the stack is `0`, this operation fails. | 2 |
| neg       | Pops the top item from the stack, computes its additive inverse, and pushes the result onto the stack. | 1      |
| inv       | Pops the top item from the stack, computes its multiplicative inverse, and pushes the result onto the stack. If the value at the top of the stack is `0`, this operation fails. | 1 |
| not       | Pops the top item from the stack, subtracts it from value `1` and pushes the result onto the stack. In other words, `0` becomes `1`, and `1` becomes `0`. If the item at the top of the stack is not binary (i.e. not `0` or `1`), this operation fails. | 1 |
| and       | Pops top two items from the stack, computes an equivalent of their boolean `AND` (which, for binary values, is just multiplication), and pushes the result onto the stack. If either of the values is not binary, the operation fails. | 1 |
| or        | Pops top two items from the stack, computes an equivalent of their boolean `OR`, and pushes the result onto the stack. If either of the values is not binary, the operation fails. | 1 |

#### Finite field arithmetic
All arithmetic operations in Distaff VM happen in a [prime field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) with modulus `340282366920938463463374557953744961537` (which can also be written as 2<sup>128</sup> - 45 * 2<sup>40</sup> + 1). This means that overflow happens after a value exceeds field modulus. So, for example: `340282366920938463463374557953744961536 + 1 = 0`.

Divisions in prime fields are defined as inverse of multiplication. Specifically, `c = a / b` means: find such `c` that `b * c = a`. This may lead to unintuitive results. For example, `1 / 2 = 170141183460469231731687278976872480769`.

### Comparison instructions

| Operation | Description                            | Cycles |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | :----: |
| eq        | Pops top two items from the stack, compares them, and if their values are equal, pushes `1` onto the stack; otherwise pushes `0` onto the stack. | 2 |
| ne        | Pops top two items from the stack, compares them, and if their values are not equal, pushes `1` onto the stack; otherwise pushes `0` onto the stack. | 3 |
| gt.*n*    | Pops top two items from the stack, compares them, and if the 1st value is greater than the 2nd value, pushes `1` onto the stack; otherwise pushes `0` onto the stack. If either of the values is greater than 2<sup>*n*</sup>, the operation fails. *n* can be any integer between 4 and 128. | *n + 14* |
| lt.*n*    | Pops top two items from the stack, compares them, and if the 1st value is less than the 2nd value, pushes `1` onto the stack; otherwise pushes `0` onto the stack. If either of the values is greater than 2<sup>*n*</sup>, the operation fails. *n* can be any integer between 4 and 128. | *n + 13* |
| rc.*n*    | Pops the top item from the stack, checks if it is less than 2<sup>*n*</sup>, and if it is, pushes `1` onto the stack; otherwise pushes `0` onto the stack. *n* can be any integer between 4 and 128.| *n + 8* |
| isodd.*n* | Pops the top item from the stack, and if its value is odd, pushes `1` onto the stack; otherwise pushes `0` onto the stack. If the value is greater than 2<sup>*n*</sup>, the operation fails. *n* can be any integer between 4 and 128. | *n + 12* |

### Selection instructions

| Operation | Description                            | Cycles |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | :----: |
| choose.1  | Pops top 3 items from the stack, and pushes either the 1st or the 2nd value back onto the stack depending on whether the 3rd value is `1` or `0`. For example, assuming `S0` is the top of the stack, `S0 S1 1` becomes `S0`, while `S0 S1 0` becomes `S1`. This operation fails if the 3rd stack item is not a binary value. | 1 |
| choose.2  | Pops top 6 items from the stack, and pushes either the 1st or the 2nd pair of values back onto the stack depending on whether the 5th value is `1` or `0`. For example, assuming `S0` is the top of the stack, `S0 S1 S2 S3 1 S5` becomes `S0 S1`, while `S0 S1 S2 S3 0 S5` becomes `S2 S3` (notice that `S5` is discarded in both cases). This operation fails if the 5th stack item is not a binary value. | 1 |

Selection instructions can be used to simulate conditional execution. This, in turn, can be used to eliminate simple *if-then-(else)* expressions. For example, if we have a program with conditional branches which looks like so:
```
if.true
    <instructions>
else
    <instructions>
end
```
We can transform it into a linear program using selection instructions like so:

1. First, execute instructions in the `if.true` branch and leave the result on the stack.
2. Then, execute instructions in the `else` branch and leave the result on the stack.
3. Finally, use `choose` or `choose.2` instruction to select between the two results based on the desired condition.

### Cryptographic instructions

| Operation | Description                            | Cycles |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | :----: |
| hash.*n*  | Pops top *n* items from the stack, computes their hash using [Rescue hash function](#Rescue-hash-function), and pushes the result onto the stack. The result is always represented by 2 stack items. *n* can be any integer between 1 and 4. | ~ 16 |
| smpath.*n* | Pops top 2 items from the stack, uses them to compute a root of a Merkle authentication path for a tree of depth *n*, and pushes the result onto the stack. The result is always represented by 2 stack items. Input tapes `A` and `B` are expected to contain nodes of the Merkle authentication path as well as binary representation of the leaf's index (see [here](#Merkle-authentication-path) for more info).  | ~ *16n* |
| pmpath.*n* | Pops top 3 items from the stack, uses the first 2 items to compute a root of a Merkle authentication path for a tree of depth *n* and a leaf indicated by the 3rd stack item, and pushes the result onto the stack. The result is always represented by 2 stack items. Input tapes `A` and `B` are expected to contain nodes of the Merkle authentication path (see [here](#Merkle-authentication-path) for more info).  | ~ *32n* |

#### Rescue hash function
Distaff VM uses a modified version of [Rescue](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/426) hash function. This modification adds half-rounds to the beginning and to the end of the standard Rescue hash function to make the arithmetization of the function fully foldable. High-level pseudo-code for the modified version looks like so:
```
for 10 iterations do:
    add round constants;
    apply s-box;
    apply MDS;
    add round constants;
    apply inverse s-box;
    apply MDS;
```
This modification should not impact security properties of the function, but it is worth noting that it has not been studied to the same extent as the standard Rescue hash function.

Parameters used for the hash function are:
* State width of 6 elements: 4 elements for rate + 2 elements for capacity.
* S-Box of power 3, though, in the future this may be changed to S-Box of power 5.


#### Merkle authentication path
As mentioned above, `smpath` and `pmpath` instructions can be used to compute roots of Merkle authentication paths, but the semantics of these instruction are somewhat complicated and deserve a bit more explanation.

Both instructions work in a similar manner, but they are intended for different use cases. Specifically:

* `smpath` instruction expects both the nodes of the Merkle authentication path and leaf index to be provided via input tapes `A` and `B`.
* `pmpath` instruction expects only the nodes of the Merkle authentication path to be provided via input tapes `A` and `B`. The leaf index is expected to be provided via the stack.

##### pmpath
First, we'll describe `pmpath` instruction. Suppose we have a Merkle tree of depth 3 which looks like so:
```
           abcd
          /    \
        ab      cd
       /  \    /  \
      a    b  c    d
```
where: `ab = hash(a, b)`, `cd = hash(c, d)`, and `abcd = hash(ab, cd)`. All of these values are 256 bits in size, and thus, we'd need two 128-bit field elements to represent each of them in Distaff VM.

If we consider leaf `c`, Merkle authentication path for this leaf would be: [`d`, `ab`], and the root of this path would be `abcd`. To compute this root in Distaff VM we can use `pmpath` instruction like so:

1. First, we need to put two elements representing leaf `c` onto the stack.
2. Then, we need to execute `pmpath.3` instruction. We set the parameter to `3` because the depth of our Merkle tree is 3.
3. The result of the operation will be the value of `abcd` sitting in the top two registers of the stack.

For the above to work, we also need to populate input tapes `A` and `B` with additional data. Specifically, these tapes should contain:

1. Values of Merkle path nodes `d` and `ab`. Since these values are 256 bits each, we need to split each value across tapes `A` and `B`. For example, `d` will be represented by two 128-bit values: d<sub>0</sub> and d<sub>1</sub>.
2. Binary decomposition of `c`'s index in the tree. In our example, this index is 2, and its binary representation is `10`. Starting with the least significant bit, each bit should be put into a separate slot on tape `A`, interlaced with nodes of the Merkle path.

Applying the above to our example, we'd get inputs tapes looking like so:

| A               | B              |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| d<sub>0</sub>   | d<sub>1</sub>  |
| 0               | 0              |
| ab<sub>0</sub>  | ab<sub>1</sub> |
| 1               | 0              |

Here is a brief explanation:
* First, we put the value `d` represented by d<sub>0</sub> and d<sub>1</sub> into tapes `A` and `B`.
* Then we put the least significant bit of `c`'s index (which is `0`) into tape `A`, and also complement it with `0` in tape `B`.
* Next, we put the value `ab` represented by ab<sub>0</sub> and ab<sub>1</sub> into tapes `A` and `B`.
* Finally, we put the next bit of `c`'s index (which is `1`) into tape `A`, and complement it with `0` in tape `B`.

Note that even though we use only tape `A` for bits of `c`'s index, we always complement these inputs with `0`'s in tape `B`.

To summarize: if our input tapes are set up as shown above, and if our stack state is [c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>0</sub>], where c<sub>1</sub> is at the top of the stack, executing `smpath.3` will transform the stack into [abcd<sub>1</sub>, abcd<sub>0</sub>].

##### pmpath
As mentioned above, `pmpath` works similarly to `smpath` but there are two important differences:

First, `pmpath` expects the index of the leaf which the Merkle path authenticates to be located in the 3rd item of the stack. So, for the example in the previous section, before we execute `pmpath` instruction, we should arrange the stack like so:

```
[c_1, c_0, 2]
```

where `2` is the position of our leaf in the Merkle tree.

Second, since the leaf's index is on the stack, we no longer need to put it onto input tapes. So, input tapes `A` and `B` would need to be populated like so:

| A               | B              |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| d<sub>0</sub>   | d<sub>1</sub>  |
| ab<sub>0</sub>  | ab<sub>1</sub> |

Then, we can execute `pmpath.3` instruction (since 3 is the depth of our Merkle tree), and after the operation completes, the value of `abcd` will be sitting in the top two registers of the stack.

Note that index value will be discarded. That is, the operation pops 3 values from the top of the stack but pushes back only 2 values.
